With the files that are inside here, you can start creating your own filters like the ones you see in Apps like Instagram, Hipstamatic etc.

What you need is Python, and some curve files.

Curve files are some special Photoshop files that alter the appearance of the image. You can find lots of them for free, and there is no need to have Photoshop installed.

Using the extractCurvesFromACVFile.py Python code, you can extract the polynomials you need, and then you can use them in your code to alter the image.
