Using this code, you can start creating your own filters like the ones you see in Apps like Instagram, Hipstamatic etc.

What you need is Python, and some curve files. To get you started there is already a sample curve file ( Country.acv ) inside the repo.

Curve files are some special Photoshop files that alter the appearance of the image. You can find lots of them for free, and there is no need to have Photoshop installed in order to create filters from them.

Using the extractCurvesFromACVFile.py Python code, you can extract the polynomials you need, and then you can use them in your code to alter the image.

Warning: The iPhone code is slow and unoptimized. It is mainly intented as a proof of concept.
There are many ways to make it better, if you want to help here are the discussions:
